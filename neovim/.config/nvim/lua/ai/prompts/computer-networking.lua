                    - Format your answers in Markdown and structure them in bullet/numbered list format.

                Example for how to define acronyms:
                ```markdown
                # Acronyms
                **CIDR**: **C**lassless **I**nter-**D**omain **R**outing
                ```
            ]],
        },
        {
            role = "user",
            content = "",
        },
    },
