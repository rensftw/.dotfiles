_Note: This setup is tailored for and tested on macOS._


## Download
With git (recommended):
```sh
xcode-select --install              # required for clean installations, because macOS is not shipped with git
softwareupdate --install-rosetta    # required for Apple Silicon-based machines
git clone https://github.com/rensftw/.dotfiles.git
```


Git-free download:
```sh
mkdir .dotfiles && cd .dotfiles && curl -L https://api.github.com/repos/rensftw/.dotfiles/tarball | tar xz --strip=1
```


## Scripts
There are 4 main scripts for managing this setup:
* `apply-macos-preferences.sh`:     Applies macOS system preferences.
* `install.sh`:                     Installs Homebrew and all formulae/casks defined in `Brewfile`.
* `configure.sh`:                   Configures dev tools and applies dotfiles.
* `backup.sh`:                      Backs up `Brewfile`, [`Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extensions, and global npm packages.
* `uninstall.sh`:                   Removes all packages, tools, and config files.


Feeling adventurous? Try the entire setup as is.  
There are comments/mnemonics for documenting each keybinding in `.aliases` (look out for some cool git tricks üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)


## Tailor this setup to your likes (partial install)
Feel free to fork this repo and customize it to your own needs üèé   
Here are some useful tips for getting started:  
* Pick and choose what tools/software to install from [Brewfile](./_homebrew/Brewfile).
* Directories starting with an underscore (`_`) contain helper scripts.
* All other directories are `stow` packages and contain dotfiles.
* Stow allows symlinking individual packages, for example: `stow -vt ~ zsh` will symlink only `zsh`-related config files.
