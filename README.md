_Note: So far, this setup has been tailored for and tested only on macOS._  

## Installation
With git (recommended):  
```sh
xcode-select --install  # required for clean installations, because macOS is not shipped with git
git clone https://github.com/rensftw/.dotfiles.git
```
  
Without version control:  
```sh
mkdir .dotfiles && cd .dotfiles && curl -L https://api.github.com/repos/rensftw/.dotfiles/tarball | tar xz --strip=1
```
  
## Setting up a new machine (full install)
Feeling adventurous? Try the entire setup as is!  
There are comments/mnemonics for documenting keybindings in all config files (start with `.aliases` for some cool git tricks ðŸª„)  

Here are 3 main scripts for managing this setup:  
* `install.sh`:     Installs tools/software and sets up config files
* `backup.sh`:      Backs up `Brewfile`, [`Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extensions, and global npm packages
* `uninstall.sh`:   Removes all global packages, tools, and config files

  
## Tailor this setup to your likes (partial install)
Feel free to fork this repo and customize it to your own needs!  
Here are some useful tips for getting started:  
* Directories starting with an underscore (`_`) contain helpers
* All other directories are `stow` packages
* You can pick and choose what configs to adopt, for example: `stow -vt ~ zsh` will symlink only `zsh`-related configs
* You can also delete any unnecessary tools/software from [Brewfile](./_homebrew/Brewfile)
  
## Highlights
* [`neovim`](https://neovim.io/) for code editing
* [`ranger`](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) for terminal file navigation
* [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) integration with (Neo)vim and aliases for interactive git operations
* [`rg`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for searching
* [`stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for dotfile management with symlinks
* [`brew`](https://brew.sh/) for macOS package management
* [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Node version management
* [`BpyTOP`](https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop) for process monitoring

Interactive staging with a preview window for git (using fzf bindings):  
There are also bindings for:
  * unstaging changes
  * discarding changes
  * inspecting stash entries
  * inspecting the git history of a branch (with commit preview)
  * switching between branches
